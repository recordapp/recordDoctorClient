# reCORd Doctor's client

This is the code for the doctor's side of things if him and his patient use our reCORd system. The web client for the doctor plots out all the necesarry data,
that has previously been recorded on the patient's mobile application, so he can get a good insight of what had been happening prior to the patients visit at the
hospital.

Features:
- Plotting the measured parameters
- Plotting from the earliest day desired (choosing the date via a calendar form)
- Password authentication for each patient
- Minimalistic, simple-to-use graphical interface
